# Automatic-COVID-19-Lung-Infection-Segmentation-From-CT-Images
Manual identification of COVID-19 lung infection is extremely time consuming and requires expertise, so we proposed „Automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images‟ system which is used to identify infected areas in lung automatically.

Aim and objectives of the Project:
1) To perform edge detection on lung CT image.
2) To perform segmentation on lung CT image.
3) To find out infected area by covid-19 virus from input image.
4) To find out the percentage of infected area.
